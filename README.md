# HolarchyBrowser

Visual mind map & list browser built with Holarchic principles.

## Purpose & Vision
HolarchyBrowser is an experimental interface for exploring thoughts, tasks and data in a holarchic way—nested lists and mind maps reflect relationships and evolution over time. Inspired by eBliss Co‑op’s vision of Emptiness and Bliss in Motion, the app helps you:

- Create and organize mind-map nodes and lists.
- Explore connections via a non‑linear, intuitive UI.
- Share holons (nodes) and lists with other peers via future peer‑to‑peer modules.
- Eventually integrate a Holarchic Temporal Engine to replay changes over time.

## Quick Start

Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eBlissCo-op/HolarchyBrowser.git
cd HolarchyBrowser/client
npm install
npm run start
```

This launches the development server and opens the app in your browser.

## Roadmap

The project is at **v0.1-alpha**, with many features planned:

- **MindMap & Lists Holons**: Create nodes, link them hierarchically, and switch between mind map and list views.
- **Holarchic Temporal Engine**: Record and replay changes across holons to understand how your ideas evolve.
- **Peer-to-Peer Sync**: Host or join a remote module to share and merge lists with friends in real time.
- **3D Visualisation**: Experiment with immersive, three‑dimensional node mapping (possibly via WebGL/Three.js).
- **Integrations**: Import/export data from other tools, share via email or messaging.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for more details.
