# HolarchyBrowser Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development milestones for HolarchyBrowser. Dates are tentative and subject to change as the project evolves.

## v0.1-alpha (Current)

- Minimal mind map & list holons: create, edit, and delete nodes/lists.
- Basic UI built with React and TypeScript.
- Local storage for saving and loading holarchies.
- Initial documentation and project setup.

## v0.2 (MindMap & Lists Holons)

- Refine mind map and list views with drag-and-drop capabilities.
- Allow linking between nodes and lists, create hierarchies, and reorder items.
- Add search and filter functionality within holons.
- Publish first alpha release for feedback.

## v0.3 (Holarchic Temporal Engine)

- Implement the Holarchic Temporal Engine to record changes and enable playback of holon evolution.
- Provide visual timeline controls to scrub through changes.
- Optimize data model for temporal snapshots.
- Add export/import of temporal data.

## v0.4 (Sharing & Collaboration)

- Introduce peer-to-peer sync module for sharing holons/lists between users.
- Handle merge conflicts and versioning gracefully.
- Support inviting collaborators and setting permissions.
- Explore integration with remote storage (e.g., IPFS).

## v0.5 (3D Visualisation)

- Prototype 3D visualization of holarchic structures using WebGL/Three.js.
- Allow users to switch between 2D and 3D views.
- Experiment with VR/AR support for immersive exploration.

## Future Ideas

- Mobile app version.
- Plugins or APIs for integration with other tools.
- AI-assisted node suggestions based on patterns.
- Enhanced customization (themes, styles).

We welcome feedback and contributions to help shape this roadmap!
