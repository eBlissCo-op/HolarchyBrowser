# Contributing to HolarchyBrowser

Thank you for considering contributing to HolarchyBrowser! We welcome contributions of all kinds — from bug reports and feature requests to code contributions and documentation improvements.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork.
2. Create a **feature branch** off of `main` for your changes.
3. Make your changes, ensuring you follow our coding standards.
4. **Commit** your work with clear, descriptive messages.
5. **Push** your branch to your fork and open a **pull request** to the `main` branch of this repo.

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for new code and maintain the existing code style (use ESLint & Prettier if configured).
- Write clear, self‑documenting code and add comments when appropriate.
- Keep functions small and focused; break complex logic into smaller pieces.
- Add or update tests if applicable.

### Commit Messages

Use descriptive commit messages. A good format is:

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description explaining what this commit does, why the change is needed, and any side effects.
```

Where `type` can be `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `refactor`, etc.

## Reporting Issues & Feature Requests

If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please [open an issue](../../issues). Include as much detail as you can to help us reproduce the issue or understand your suggestion.
